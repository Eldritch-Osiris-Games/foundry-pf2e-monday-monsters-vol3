Known as an arcane inkling, this strange ooze born of magic demonstrates a surprising inquisitiveness and curiosity, particularly in regards to magic. They gather in areas where magic abounds, instinctively seeking out mystic ruins, cult enclaves, and academies of arcane arts. Many arcane inklings seek to add to their repertoire of spells by absorbing other scrolls and books, leading to many spellcasters to regard them as pests. They can be particularly disastrous in magic schools or scroll shops if not caught quickly, wreaking havoc both through their destructions of scrolls and spellbooks as well as their growing mystic might.

An actinaris will typically spend its entire life in the water even though it is able to go on land. It feeds on local wildlife and is even willing to allow fisherman who are respectful of the reef to fish there. When mortals are wasteful or cause harm to the reef, the actinaris will strike back at them, drowning those that intrude upon its domain and using their bones to decorate the reef. The actinaris will eat anything that enters its domain, including humanoids it has slain. Actinaris who consistently encounter those who mistreat and abuse their coastal homes can become violent to mortals on sight and will sabotage boats and drown the passengers on sight. An actinaris is 5 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.</p>\n<p>While actinaris are traditionally solitary, they will gather in large groups periodically where they will confer with each other and breed. Only occasionally do actinaris couples remain together though they are caring parents that raise their children to adulthood before encouraging to go out into the world and discover it for themselves. Some actinaris couples do stay together and will both occupy the same reef, raising their family and protecting their home together.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Fey Pranks</h2>\n<p>Typically capricious by nature, fey often have a tendency to play pranks on mortals and occasionally even other fey. These pranks can range from benign to outright malicious but they are almost always dangerous to mortal victims. Many fey fail to consider the lethality of their pranks when applied to those that don’t simply reconstitute in the fey plane. Older fey tend to craft even grander pranks in an attempt to stave off their boredom with new experiences. Acrinaris aren’t as prone to pranks but will occasionally butt up against ships, pretend to be sea monsters, and even capsize smaller vessels.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["amphibious","fey"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, wavesense 30

An actinaris will typically spend its entire life in the water even though it is able to go on land. It feeds on local wildlife and is even willing to allow fisherman who are respectful of the reef to fish there. When mortals are wasteful or cause harm to the reef, the actinaris will strike back at them, drowning those that intrude upon its domain and using their bones to decorate the reef. The actinaris will eat anything that enters its domain, including humanoids it has slain. Actinaris who consistently encounter those who mistreat and abuse their coastal homes can become violent to mortals on sight and will sabotage boats and drown the passengers on sight. An actinaris is 5 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.</p>\n<p>While actinaris are traditionally solitary, they will gather in large groups periodically where they will confer with each other and breed. Only occasionally do actinaris couples remain together though they are caring parents that raise their children to adulthood before encouraging to go out into the world and discover it for themselves. Some actinaris couples do stay together and will both occupy the same reef, raising their family and protecting their home together.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Fey Pranks</h2>\n<p>Typically capricious by nature, fey often have a tendency to play pranks on mortals and occasionally even other fey. These pranks can range from benign to outright malicious but they are almost always dangerous to mortal victims. Many fey fail to consider the lethality of their pranks when applied to those that don’t simply reconstitute in the fey plane. Older fey tend to craft even grander pranks in an attempt to stave off their boredom with new experiences. Acrinaris aren’t as prone to pranks but will occasionally butt up against ships, pretend to be sea monsters, and even capsize smaller vessels.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"value":["amphibious","fey"],"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, wavesense 30

Errant eyes typically have little interest in combat and their first tactic is always to flee, but if forced into an encounter, they readily wield their feeble claws and ability to transmit the sights they’ve seen against their foes, hoping to leave them dazed long enough to escape. Their ability to see the truth of things is highly valued by many, particularly mages, and is more pronounced given their otherwise weak nature. Despite the value errant eyes hold, attempts to capture and tame them have been met with little luck. Some scholars have put forth the suggestion that errant eyes essentially feed off of visual stimuli and the doldrums of captivity often results in them perishing before any sort of training can be completed.

Also known as pragmani, they seem to be linked to mortals, coming into being from the very fabric of the Wylde when a mortal couple first falls in love. Such pragmani begin small with light coloration of pink and white, but typically don’t live long enough to mature, merely fading back into the ether of their home as the love between their bonded pair dwindles. However, some pragmani are linked to a couple that develop a deeper, truer love, which allows them to grow and mature. Such pragmani usually find a means to travel to the Material Plane where they serve as caretakers and guardians of the couple that they are linked to. They protect them from threats both natural and otherwise – whether it be ensuring a safe journey as one member makes their way home to their partner or keeping succubi and similarly evil creatures from bringing ruin to the relationship. Pragmani are content to live their entire life unobserved, simply helping their bonded pair flourish from the sidelines.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Enemies of Pragmani</h2>\n<p>While guardian of pragma protect their wards from all manners of threats that endanger their relationship, they take particular grievance with succubi, vampires, and other creatures that cruelly seduce and mislead others.

They lurk in darkened corners, simply watching and observing the world with an unnerving dedication before skittering away to take in new sights. Errant eyes typically have little interest in combat and their first tactic is always to flee, but if forced into an encounter, they readily wield their feeble claws and ability to transmit the sights they’ve seen against their foes, hoping to leave them dazed long enough to escape. Their ability to see the truth of things is highly valued by many, particularly mages, and is more pronounced given their otherwise weak nature. Despite the value errant eyes hold, attempts to capture and tame them have been met with little luck. Some scholars have put forth the suggestion that errant eyes essentially feed off of visual stimuli and the doldrums of captivity often results in them perishing before any sort of training can be completed.

Known as an arcane inkling, this strange ooze born of magic demonstrates a surprising inquisitiveness and curiosity, particularly in regards to magic. They gather in areas where magic abounds, instinctively seeking out mystic ruins, cult enclaves, and academies of arcane arts. Many arcane inklings seek to add to their repertoire of spells by absorbing other scrolls and books, leading to many spellcasters to regard them as pests. They can be particularly disastrous in magic schools or scroll shops if not caught quickly, wreaking havoc both through their destructions of scrolls and spellbooks as well as their growing mystic might.

An actinaris will typically spend its entire life in the water even though it is able to go on land. It feeds on local wildlife and is even willing to allow fisherman who are respectful of the reef to fish there. When mortals are wasteful or cause harm to the reef, the actinaris will strike back at them, drowning those that intrude upon its domain and using their bones to decorate the reef. The actinaris will eat anything that enters its domain, including humanoids it has slain. Actinaris who consistently encounter those who mistreat and abuse their coastal homes can become violent to mortals on sight and will sabotage boats and drown the passengers on sight. An actinaris is 5 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.</p>\n<p>While actinaris are traditionally solitary, they will gather in large groups periodically where they will confer with each other and breed. Only occasionally do actinaris couples remain together though they are caring parents that raise their children to adulthood before encouraging to go out into the world and discover it for themselves. Some actinaris couples do stay together and will both occupy the same reef, raising their family and protecting their home together.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Fey Pranks</h2>\n<p>Typically capricious by nature, fey often have a tendency to play pranks on mortals and occasionally even other fey. These pranks can range from benign to outright malicious but they are almost always dangerous to mortal victims. Many fey fail to consider the lethality of their pranks when applied to those that don’t simply reconstitute in the fey plane. Older fey tend to craft even grander pranks in an attempt to stave off their boredom with new experiences. Acrinaris aren’t as prone to pranks but will occasionally butt up against ships, pretend to be sea monsters, and even capsize smaller

This ink coalesces and leaves the page, often fleeing the scene in its initial panic at its sudden sentience. Known as an arcane inkling, this strange ooze born of magic demonstrates a surprising inquisitiveness and curiosity, particularly in regards to magic. They gather in areas where magic abounds, instinctively seeking out mystic ruins, cult enclaves, and academies of arcane arts. Many arcane inklings seek to add to their repertoire of spells by absorbing other scrolls and books, leading to many spellcasters to regard them as pests. They can be particularly disastrous in magic schools or scroll shops if not caught quickly, wreaking havoc both through their destructions of scrolls and spellbooks as well as their growing mystic might. Made from mystical ink, arcane inklings assume various shapes though most end up mimicking silhouettes of archetypal mystics. Runes periodically flash across the sheen of their form, flickering with the power contained in their body.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Different Spelling</h2>\n<p>While traditionally called arcane inklings, these magic oozes can be formed from the scroll of any magic tradition. Additionally, there have been rare instances of large and more powerful arcane inklings born from higher-leveled spells.

An actinaris will typically spend its entire life in the water even though it is able to go on land. It feeds on local wildlife and is even willing to allow fisherman who are respectful of the reef to fish there. When mortals are wasteful or cause harm to the reef, the actinaris will strike back at them, drowning those that intrude upon its domain and using their bones to decorate the reef. The actinaris will eat anything that enters its domain, including humanoids it has slain. Actinaris who consistently encounter those who mistreat and abuse their coastal homes can become violent to mortals on sight and will sabotage boats and drown the passengers on sight. An actinaris is 5 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.</p>\n<p>While actinaris are traditionally solitary, they will gather in large groups periodically where they will confer with each other and breed. Only occasionally do actinaris couples remain together though they are caring parents that raise their children to adulthood before encouraging to go out into the world and discover it for themselves. Some actinaris couples do stay together and will both occupy the same reef, raising their family and protecting their home together.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Fey Pranks</h2>\n<p>Typically capricious by nature, fey often have a tendency to play pranks on mortals and occasionally even other fey.

An actinaris will typically spend its entire life in the water even though it is able to go on land. It feeds on local wildlife and is even willing to allow fisherman who are respectful of the reef to fish there. When mortals are wasteful or cause harm to the reef, the actinaris will strike back at them, drowning those that intrude upon its domain and using their bones to decorate the reef. The actinaris will eat anything that enters its domain, including humanoids it has slain. Actinaris who consistently encounter those who mistreat and abuse their coastal homes can become violent to mortals on sight and will sabotage boats and drown the passengers on sight. An actinaris is 5 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.</p>\n<p>While actinaris are traditionally solitary, they will gather in large groups periodically where they will confer with each other and breed. Only occasionally do actinaris couples remain together though they are caring parents that raise their children to adulthood before encouraging to go out into the world and discover it for themselves. Some actinaris couples do stay together and will both occupy the same reef, raising their family and protecting their home together.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Fey Pranks</h2>\n<p>Typically capricious by nature, fey often have a tendency to play pranks on mortals and occasionally even other fey. These pranks can range from benign to outright malicious but they are almost always dangerous to mortal victims. Many fey fail to consider the lethality of their pranks when applied to those that don’t simply reconstitute in the fey plane. Older fey tend to craft even grander pranks in an attempt to stave off their boredom with new experiences. Acrinaris aren’t as prone to pranks but will occasionally butt up against ships, pretend to be sea monsters, and even capsize smaller
